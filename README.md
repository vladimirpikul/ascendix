1. Completed UI with html & css.
2. Main data stored in "properties.json" file.
3. Data fetches from "json" to main layout within "app.js".
4. Implemented Google Map within "app.js".

Note: since "properties.json" lays locally, some browsers may failure to load main page. Try "Mozilla" or access "properties.json" via http, https.
